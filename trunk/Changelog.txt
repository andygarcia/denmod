3.21.35

- BUG: Daily manually filled containers were not being filled correctly after recent hydrology changes.

3.21.34

- CHG: Containers with weekly or monthly manual fills and/or drawdowns that are subgrouped will have desynchronized hydrology for their individual subgroups by choosing a random day within the period for the fill or draw to occur.

3.21.33

3.21.32

- CHG: Fixed how Serology spreadsheet was generated for DENSiM save all functionality.
- CHG: Added daily food addition and consumption as container output in CIMSiM.

3.21.31

- CHG: Removed initial population limit at Dana's request to allow for more extensive DENSiM testing.

3.21.3

- CHG: CIMSiM's main output graph now shows 100's of eggs and larvae, similar to the DOS version.
- CHG: Adult feeding/biting parameters for DENSiM once again exposed in biology dialogs.
- CHG: Added better error reporting for more of DENSiM's demographic/virology parameters.

3.21.2

3.21.1

- CHG: Changed maximum population size for DENSiM simulations to 1,000,000.
- CHG: Added validation to container such that drawdown cannot exceed container capacity.
- CHG: Last column in food fitter was renamed to reflect absolute difference.
- CHG: Added labels to container graph selection dialog for clarity.

3.21

- CHG: Structural changes to gui and object code to accomodate LHS input and sensitivity analysis studies.
- CHG: Added chart to CIMSiM output for immature development rates (per container).
